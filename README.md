# Sophia Liau - Personal Website

Hello! This is my personal website. 
Initially I thought this would be my professional portfolio, however I have had a little too fun with the stylistic aspect of it all.
So this is my informal, cute, fab personal site!

## Project Structure

- `/public` - Contains all static assets served to clients
  - `/assets` - Images, icons, and other resources
  - `/scripts` - JavaScript files
  - `/styles` - CSS stylesheets
  - HTML files for all pages

- `/routes` - Express.js route handlers for API endpoints
- `server.js` - Node.js/Express server configuration

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
